# Project2
BIMM143 Project 2 R Studio 

Scientific Question: 
What are the similarities and differences between the replicase polyprotein 1A sequence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), bat-SL-CoVZC45 (BAT-CoV), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronvirus (MERS-CoV)?

Homology Models were built using SWISS MODEL program. Links to the homology model are listed below: 

SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Model

SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV Model 
https://swissmodel.expasy.org/interactive/3snjNV/

SARS-CoV-2 and bat-CoV Model

To complete this bioinformatics analysis the following files will be required: 

FASTA file with the 4 replicase polyprotein 1a sequences (Note: Sequences were downloaded from the UniProt database) needed to conduct a multiple sequence alignment and heatmap analysis

1. replicase_seq.fasta 

PDB files from the homology model needed to view the models in R Studio 

2. MERS_SARS.pdb

3. SARS_SARS2.pdb

4. bat_SARS2.pdb 

JSON files from the Homology Model needed to read the quantitative data in R Studio 

5. MERS_SARS2.json

6. SARS_SARS2.json

7. bat_SARS2.json
